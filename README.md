### Hello!
I am a senior student at Brigham Young University. I will be graduating in May with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics, with a Data Science Emphasis. I look forward to learning more about machine learning, data analysis, and data visualizations. 

- I’m currently learning Python and Git
- I have take classes in C++, Linux, Bash, SQL, SAS, and R
- Fun fact: I met my spouse playing *Dungeons & Dragons*
