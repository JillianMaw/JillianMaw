### Hello!
I am a graduate from Brigham Young University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics, with a Data Science Emphasis. I look forward to learning more about machine learning, data analysis, and data visualizations. 

- I’m currently expanding my soft skills by working in Customer Service in a phones role.
- I have take classes in Python, Git, C++, Linux, Bash, SQL, SAS, and R
- Fun fact: I met my spouse playing *Dungeons & Dragons*
